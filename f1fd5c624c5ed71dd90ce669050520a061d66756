- spec adapterized,
- added applnk patch: install desktop file in applnk tree and in Multimedia
  subdirectory (IMHO it is much beter place for mp3 tools),
- added pixmaps_path patch wich change install path for yamt pixmapx to
  %%{_datadir}/pixmaps instead %%{_datadir}/pixmaps/yamt (this is only one png
  file),
- removed bashizm from %build (use "VAR=<valuve>; export VAR" instead
  "export VAR=<valuve>"),
- added using %%configure macro in %build and DESTDIR style install,
- removed stripping in %install (pass LDFLAGS="-s" to ./configure env
  poroduces on linking stripped binaries),
- fix installing .mo files by add "gettextixe --copy --force in %build
  (added gettext-devel to BuildRequires),
- removed COPYING from %doc (clear license stantment is in License field).
